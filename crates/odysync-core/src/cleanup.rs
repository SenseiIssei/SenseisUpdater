//! The model and the safety rules for disk cleanup.
//!
//! Cleanup is the part of a maintenance tool that can destroy a user's data,
//! so the rules live here — pure, unit-tested on every platform — rather than
//! inside the code that calls `remove_file`.
//!
//! Three invariants, in the order they matter:
//!
//! 1. **Scan, then delete what was ticked.** Never the other way round. A
//!    category reports its size and file count first; deleting happens only
//!    for categories the caller passed back in.
//! 2. **Nothing outside a declared root.** Every candidate path is checked
//!    against its category's root with [`is_within`], and the roots themselves
//!    are checked with [`is_safe_cleanup_root`] so a bug or a hostile
//!    environment variable cannot aim the cleaner at `C:\Windows`.
//! 3. **Say what cannot be undone.** [`Reversibility`] is part of the model,
//!    not a note in the UI, so a front-end cannot forget to show it.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent: anything that edits the registry to "clean" it,
//! any memory optimiser, and any TCP tuning. See `PLAN.md` §4.
