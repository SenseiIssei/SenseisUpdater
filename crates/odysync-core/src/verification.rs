//! Who verifies the bytes before they are executed.
//!
//! `README.md` used to list "installer digest verification and signature
//! checking" as a feature. The `odysync-verify` crate exists and is correct,
//! but it had no call sites: nothing on the apply path ever called it. The
//! claim was a dependency edge, not a behaviour.
//!
//! The reason is structural rather than an oversight. Odysync almost never
//! holds an installer file. It asks winget, apt, Homebrew or the Windows
//! Update Agent to perform the update, and those tools download, verify and
//! execute the payload inside their own process. There is no file for us to
//! hash. The one exception is the offline cache, which fetches an installer
//! over HTTPS itself — and that path now does call `odysync-verify`.
//!
//! So rather than invent a check we cannot perform, this module answers the
//! question the user actually has: *something* verified this — what was it?
//! A "Verified ✓" badge that means "winget probably did something" is worse
//! than a line saying "verified by winget, not by Odysync", because the first
//! one is indistinguishable from a check we ran ourselves.
